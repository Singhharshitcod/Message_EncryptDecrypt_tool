# Message_EncryptDecrypt_tool
A fun, basic string encryption and decryption algorithm written in Python.
This project demonstrates a simple way to obfuscate and reverse strings using basic list manipulation and randomization.

✨ Features
Encrypts strings of any length
Strings longer than 3 characters:
Shifts the first character to the end
Adds 3 random alphabetic characters at the beginning
Adds 3 random digits at the end
Strings with length ≤ 3:
Reverses the string
Includes decryption function that perfectly restores the original message
Educational and easy to understand
Great for learning basic string manipulation, lists, loops, and randomization in Python
